•	(Optional) For added print quality use support material for SOHO_Part3
•	ABS and PLA plastic filament have been tested successfully

Assembly
1.	Remove printed parts from print bed
2.	Clean up parts as necessary. Some printers may deposit extra material for the first layer that may need to be removed.
3.	Press fit SOHO_Part2 and SOHO_Part3. Use the two pins on the top of SOHO_Part2 as guides. Note, this should be a snug fit.
4.	If available, find a small segment of extra 1.75mm filament. Else skip to Step 9.
5.	Cut the 1.75mm filament into 4 small pieces around 10mm long.
6.	Press these segments into each of the 4 holes on the bottom surface of SOHO_Part1.
7.	Take SOHO_Part2 and match up the holes with the protruding filament in SOHO_Part1.
8.	Press fit SOHO_Part1 and SOHO_Part2 together.
9.	For extra support a dab of super glue can be used between SOHO_Part1 and SOHO_Part2
