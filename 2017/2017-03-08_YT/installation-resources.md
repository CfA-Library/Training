Installation 
------------

If you have Anaconda Python, you can install yt using conda:

conda install yt

For any other Python distribution, you can install with pip:

pip install yt

Either of these methods should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows for 64-bit platforms. If you have a 32-bit Linux platform, pip is guaranteed to work. 32-bit Windows is not supported. 

Please make sure that Jupyter is also installed (via the same methods). If you have issues with installation please show up at 9 am to get help. 

Sample Datasets
---------------

The following datasets will need to be downloaded from http://yt-project.org/data:

http://yt-project.org/data/MHDSloshing.tar.gz
http://yt-project.org/data/IsolatedGalaxy.tar.gz
http://yt-project.org/data/snapshot_033.tar.gz

These are necessary to run the examples. 

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

Please download the notebooks at http://github.com/jzuhone/cfa_yt_workshop so you 
can follow along. Untar the sample data directories into the same directory as 
these notebooks. 

Houdini
-------

For those of you who would like to stay in the afternoon and learn how to use yt 
to read your data into the industry standard Visual Effects package Houdini, 
please download Houdini (the free version is fine) following these instructions
here: http://www.ytini.com/getstarted.html

Also please download the two *.hip* files here: http://www.ytini.com/listofHoudiniFiles.html
